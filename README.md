# google-calendar-api-ruby

Some scripts to grab data from a public google calendar to be displayed on a digital sign.

You will need public google calendars and an API key.  The file config/config-example.yml should be renamed
to config/config.yml and edited with your calendar ids and API key.  You should not store your config.yml 
file with your actual API key in a public repository.
